\section{Introduction}
%unn√∂tige introduction .. \\

In the course of this seminar we participate in the PACE Challenge 2023. This years Challenge is about twin-width, a graph parameter that measures the distance of a graph to a co-graph. Introduced in 2020 The parameter did lead to many theoretical results but as of now its not real practical tested. So Our goal is to implement and test it to bridge the gap between theory and practice. %add reference to https://pacechallenge.org/2023/

The twin-width algorithm is an new approach to solve graph theory problems that are commonly solved by the tree width algorithm. The starting point of our paper will be a short summary of the algorithm. Afterwards we will introduce a way to implement it in C++.
%Beschreibung...

graphs that can be reduced to a single vertex by a process of repeatedly finding any two twin vertices and merging them into a single vertex. The definition of twin-width mimics this reduction process.
there are false and true twins.

true twins have the same set of edges A = B
 false twins have a similar set of edges the edges that differ will be marked red  {A / B  && B/A} == red

 the twin width is the variable that sets the maximum of red edges that appear by a reduction of a graph G. This variable can be used to upper-bound the complexity for certain algorithms from NP-Complexity to Polynomial Complexity.
