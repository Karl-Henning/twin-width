Twin-width
The twin-width of a graph is an indicator for its complexity and studies how efficient different algorithms will perform. 
Basically it's a non-negative integer measuring a graphs distance to being a Cograph.
A Cograph is described by the following properties:
1. K1 is a Cograph.
2. If G is a Cograph the complement of G is also a Cograph.
3. If G and U are Cographs thier disjoint union is also a Cograph.
This implies that you can find two twins in every Cograph, that you can contract together and iterate the process until you have only a singleton left.
Now the idea is that a graph has bounded twin-width if we can contract it to a singleton by contracting near-twins together
(two vertices whose neighborhoods differ only on a bounded number of elements). We actually track the errors and call the edges we need to add "red edges".
A grpah has now twin-width d if we can bound the degree in red edges by the treshhold d. Because Cographs don't produce errors they always have twin-width 0.
